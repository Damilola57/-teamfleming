# :computer: Welcome to Team Fleming's Repo! 

**#TeamFleming** is a multicultural group of 20 young bioinformatics enthusiasts participating in the 2021 HackBio Virtual Summer Internship. The HackBio 2021 Internship is a 5-week, fast-paced opportunity for budding scientists to gain advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills while collaborating on real-world projects. 

Following the footsteps of renowned scientist and drug developer, **Alexander Fleming**, #TeamFleming is taking their first steps to learning digital skills required to make impact at the intersection of biology & tech.

# Our Task
Our first task as Stage Zero Interns in the HackBio internship was tagged, **The Spreadsheet Project**. 

Here's a pictorial representation of what we had to do

# How to get the .CSV file of our meta data?
First, the following dependencies should be installed. We tried our code on Windows 10 using Git Bash to run the bash script.

**Julia :** you can download it from https://julialang.org/downloads/ and use this tutorial to install it https://datatofish.com/install-julia/ .

**g++ compiler :** you can download MinGW that contains both gcc and g++ for windows from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/ and you can use this tutorial to install it https://techsupportwhale.com/install-gcc-compiler-on-windows/ .

**Ruby :** you can download it from https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ .

**R :** you can download it from https://cran.r-project.org/ .

**Python :** you can download it from here https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

**JavaScript :** you can download it from here https://nodejs.org/en/download/ .

**Perl :** you can doenload it from here https://www.perl.org/get.html .

Second, you will need to download the bash script named **"CSV_generator.sh"** and run it on any bash environment (we used Git Bash) as:
       $ ./job.sh
